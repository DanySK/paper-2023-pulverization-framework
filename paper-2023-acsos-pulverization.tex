\begin{abstract}
In recent years, we witnessed a fast-paced evolution of the infrastructure hosting distributed computations.
%
Modern applications are designed to be executed on very diverse devices
and to be deployed on infrastructures composed of devices ranging from cloud servers to mobile and IoT devices,
constituting together a cloud-edge continuum.
%
The availability of such an infrastructure opens to better resource utilisation and performance,
but, contextually, introduces new challenges to software designers,
as applications must be conceived to be able to adapt their deployment to changing conditions.
%
In this paper,
we introduce a framework for the development of distributed systems
based on the concept of \emph{pulverisation},
meant to neatly separate business logic and deployment concerns,
allowing applications to be defined independent of the infrastructure they will execute upon.
%
The framework is based on a domain-specific language capturing,
in a declarative fashion,
pulverised application components, device capabilities, resource allocation, and (runtime re-) configuration policies.
%
The framework, implemented in Kotlin multiplatform and available as open source,
is then evaluated in a small-scale real-world demo and in a city-scale simulated scenario.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Recent research trends in topics related to the Internet of Things promote the idea of a cloud-edge continuum~\cite{DBLP:journals/iot/BittencourtISFM18},
an infrastructure composed of heterogeneous devices ranging from large and powerful cloud servers to small connected things
on which software computes in a distributed fashion,
optimising for performance and resource utilisation.
%
Exploiting this intriguing infrastructure, however, poses new challenges to the application designer.
%
Commonly, in fact, applications are designed with a specific infrastructure in mind,
whose assumptions leak into the application logic.

Previous work suggests a technique for decoupling business logic and deployment concerns
called \emph{pulverization}~\cite{FI2020-pulverization}.
%
In short, the core idea is to consider devices as \emph{logical} entities,
whose software can be designed as (or broken down to, if already existing) an ensemble of five micro-components
(behaviour, state, communication, sensors, and actuators)
whose actual host can be decided at deployment time.
%
This way, the designer can focus on the business logic at hand,
delaying an optimised deployment to later stages of the sofware design,
thus gaining resilience to changes in the infrastructure or in non-functional requirements.
%
One limitation of the current pulverisation approach regards dynamicity:
although the application can be deployed on arbitrary systems,
there is no support for the reconfiguration of components in face of changing conditions or requirements.

In this work,
we continue the research on pulverised systems by providing two key contributions:
first, we extend the theoretical framework of pulverisation by adding support for
\emph{runtime configuration rules}, allowing pulverised components to move at runtime across different hosts;
the providing a practical implementation called \ourframework{} which,
to the best of our knowledge,
is the first \emph{practical framework supporting pulverisation} for a general-purpose language.
%
We exercise \ourframework{} with two case studies:
a small-scale real-wold demonstration, and a city-scale simulated scenario.

\begin{itemize}
    \item need for deployment-independent specs
    \item need for runtime reconfiguration (achieve QoS in face of changing conditions --- green computing?)
    \item declarativity over imperative approaches (note: can be compared with the trend in general softeng/build systems)
\end{itemize}

\section{A framework for declarative runtime reconfiguration}\label{sec:contribution}

The goal of pulverisation~\cite{FI2020-pulverization}
is to provide application designers a way to specify the functional semantics of their software in a deployment-independent way.
%
To do so,
the application logic should be designed considering a \emph{logical system},
namely, a network of \emph{logical} devices forming a network with \emph{arbitrary} topology.
%
For a pulverisation system to work,
the application of every single logical device must be decomposable into an ensemble of \emph{pulverised components}
representing, respectively:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a set $\sigma$ of logical sensors;
    \item a set $\alpha$ of logical actuators;
    \item a state $\kappa$, representing the logical device's knowledge;
    \item a communication component $\chi$,
    handling interaction with reachable devices in the logical system, and
    \item a computation component $\beta$, modelling the behaviour of the logic device.
\end{itemize}
%
Decomposition of an application into pulverised components can be achieved in two ways:
either the application is designed with pulverisation in mind,
or the application is developed using a framework supporting automatic decomposition
(one notable example are aggregate computing frameworks~\cite{BealIEEEComputer2015}).
%
Once the application has been pulverised,
a mapping must be provided between the pulverised logical system and the hosts that will execute the pulverised components.
%
In this process,
a single logical component could be (and usually does) end up being executed on multiple hosts.

For instance, let us assume a minimal logical system counting two devices:
two rain gauges logging the water level for future reference,
and opening a valve when the water level crosses a threshold in both devices.
%
Once pulverised, the logical system would be split in ten deployable pulverised components
(that we indicate with their component symbol and an index, e.g., $\sigma_1$ is the logical sensor of the first device).
%
These pulverised components can be deployed in arbitrary hosts,
as far as they have the \emph{capabilities} required to host them
(for instance, the component hosting a rain gauge logical sensor must have an actual sensor,
while the component hosting the behaviour must be sufficiently powerful to execute the logic).
%
Thus, with \emph{no change to the application logic},
the system could be deployed on very different systems:
let us assume, for instance,
that our actual target infrastructure is not composed of two connected devices,
but it is an existing \ac{iot} system
where the rain gauges are connected to two LoRaWAN motes
(which are too weak and energy-critical to execute the logic),
the valves are controlled by a dedicated device,
the levels must be logged on a database hosted on a cloud server reachable via HTTPS,
and we have an internal edge server that we can use as we please.
%
In this case, we would deploy $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ on the motes,
$\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ on the valve controller,
$\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ on the cloud server,
and the remaining components on the edge server.

\subsection{Domain-specific languages for pulverisation}

From the previous section,
we can identify two main phases in the pulverisation process:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\it{(\roman*)}]
  \item the definition of the available devices and their capabilities; and
  \item the allocation of the pulverised components to them.
\end{enumerate*}
%
We decided to capture these phases into two distinct \acp{dsl}.

The first domain-specific language allows to define the system in terms of
\emph{devices}, \emph{components} and which \emph{capabilities} requires to be executed.
%
In this way, infrastructural and deployment aspects are abstracted, allowing the focus to be on functional aspects of the system.
%
The DSL enables the definition of the type of devices that took part in the system,
and for each device can be specified which components constitute it and where those component must run on (e.g. which host must execute the component).
%
The execution of a component is constrained to hosts with predetermined characteristics:
the framework models the constraint with the \texttt{Capability} concept,
namely the property that a host must to ``implement'' to run the component.
%
Different capabilities can be specified for each component to provide a more flexible and scalable deployment of the system.

The~\Cref{lst:system-configuration} provides an example of the usage of the domain-specific language where is defined a system composed of two kind of devices.
%
The DSL returns the system's configuration that will be used by the runtime.

One key-point of the domain-specific language can be observed in the definition of the \texttt{device-2} device:
the \emph{Behaviour} component can be deployed on hosts that implement the \texttt{HighCPU} and \texttt{EmbeddedDevice} capabilities,
in this way the behaviour can be moved (at runtime) from a host to another one that implements the same capabilities.
%
The association between a component and a single capability do not necessarily imply that the component can be executed only on a single host,
but it is the way to specify the minimum requirements for the host that will execute the component.

\lstinputlisting[
    float=ht,
    language=Kotlin,
    caption={
        Example of the usage of the domain-specific language for the system configuration.
        The example configures two types of devices, and for each device defines the components that compose it and which capabilities requires for the execution.
    },
    label=lst:system-configuration,
]{listings/SystemConfig.kt}

The second domain-specific language allows to define the concrete implementation of each component associating it to a specific start host;
moreover, it allows to define the creteria on which the system should be reconfigured by specifying which events should trigger a reconfiguration.
%
This DSL binds the more abstrac definition specified in the previous DSL to the topology of the available infrastracture,
defining the actual deployment of the system, and the reconfiguration policies.
%
The~\Cref{lst:runtime-configuration} provides an example of the usage of the domain-specific language where is defined the runtime configuration of the system.
%
The framework define the concept of \texttt{Host} that is the representation of an available physical host where the components can be deployed;
for each host is possible to specify the capabilities that it implements.
%
In this way, the framework can check if a host can execute a component by verifying if the host implements the required capabilities.
%
The runtime is configured be specifying for each implementation of a \emph{component},
its associated startup host enabling the definition of the initial deployment of the system.
%
The most relevant part of the domain-specific language, is the definition of the reconfiguration rules:
the framework models the concept of \texttt{ReconfigurationEvent}
that is the event that triggers the reconfiguration of the system.
%
The DSL allows the association of a \texttt{ReconfigurationEvent}
to a new deployment of the system which is defined as the new association between component and host.

\lstinputlisting[
    float=ht,
    language=Kotlin,
    caption={
        Example of the usage of the domain-specific language for the runtime configuration.
        The example defines the runtime configuration of the system, specifying the initial deployment and the reconfiguration rules.
    },
    label=lst:runtime-configuration,
]{listings/RuntimeConfig.kt}

A \texttt{ReconfigurationEvent} is characterized by the \emph{events}
that it produces and the \emph{condition} that must be satisfied to trigger the reconfiguration.
%
The \emph{events} are represented as an asyncronous stream of valued produced by the device and the
\emph{condition} is a predicate that is evaluated on the stream of events.
%
At the first match of the condition, the reconfiguration is triggered and the system is reconfigured with the new deployment.
%
The~\Cref{lst:reconfiguration-events} shows an example of the definition of a reconfiguration event.

\lstinputlisting[
    float=ht,
    language=Kotlin,
    caption={Example of the definition of a reconfiguration event.},

\subsection{Implementation details}

Also mention that is multiplatform

\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}

In this section,
we exercise the proposed framework with two case studies.
%
In the former,
we show a small-scale demonstrator of a safety system warning people when a room capacity is exceeded
to showcase the integration of the framework with established technologies\footnote{
    \url{https://github.com/nicolasfara/ACSOS-2023-pulverization-crowd-room}
};
in the latter,
we simulate a city-scale distributed application deployed for a urban event
and show how the dynamic reconfiguration may help achieving balance between energy consumption and QoS\footnote{
    \url{https://github.com/nicolasfara/ACSOS-2023-pulverization-evaluation}
}.
%
Both experiments have been released with a permissive open-source license and have been archived for future reference on Zenodo~\cite{TBD}.

\subsection{Small scale: crowd alert}
\label{sec:small-scale-crowd-alert}

In this section we present a simple scenario where the pulverization framework is used to implement a crowd alert system:
we simulate a laboratory where a safety system warns people when they are too close to each other.
%
Each person is equipped with a wearable device that is able to detect the distance from other devices and send the distances data to the
alert system.
%
The people in the laboratory must observe a safety distance, and the system warns them when the distance is not respected by showing a red light
when they are too close to each other, and a green color when the distance is respected (see~\Cref{fig:crowd-alert}).
%
\begin{figure*}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{figures/crow-laboratory-demo.drawio.pdf}
    \caption{
        Representation of the scenario described in the~\Cref{sec:small-scale-crowd-alert}
        where more the people are far from each other, more the color of the screen is green.
        More the people are close to each other, more the color of the screen is red.
        The blue dot represents the wearable device and the link between the devices represents the distance between them.
        The rectangle represents the monitor in the laboratory which shows the congestion level of the laboratory (via the color described above).
    }
    \label{fig:crowd-alert}
\end{figure*}
%
The system is composed of two kind of devices: \emph{wearable} and \emph{laboratory}.
%
The former represents the wearable devices that is worn by the people, and consists of the following pulverized components:
$\beta$, $\chi$, and $\sigma$.
%
The \emph{behaviour} ($\beta$) component is responsible for converting the raw data from the sensor into the distance
between the device and the others; the \emph{sensors} ($\sigma$) component is responsible for perceiving the other devices and
the \emph{communication} ($\chi$) component is responsible for sending the data to the alert system.
%
The latter represents the alert system and consists of the following pulverized components:
$\beta$, $\kappa$, $\chi$, and $\alpha$.
%
The \emph{behaviour} ($\beta$) component is responsible for evaluating the meand distance between the devices,
the \emph{actuators} ($\alpha$) is responsible for triggering the alarm showing a color in the screen,
and the \emph{communication} ($\chi$) component is responsible for receiving the data from the wearable devices.

The infrastructure defined for this scenario is described as follow:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Smartphones} are the devices used by the people to detect the distance from the others;
    \item \emph{Local PC} is the device used to show the alarm in the laboratory;
    \item \emph{Server} is the device used run the crowd algorithm and the wearable logic. 
\end{itemize}

The initial deployment of the system starts with the $\beta_{werable}$ executed in the \emph{Server},
the $\sigma_{wearable}$ and $\chi_{werable}$ executed in the \emph{Smartphones},
and all the \emph{Laboratory} components are executed in the \emph{Local PC}.
%
Given the infrastracture defined above, we simulate also a condition where the \emph{Server} is overloaded and, via pulverization,
we want to lighteninig the load of the \emph{Server} by moving the $\beta_{werable}$ in the \emph{Smartphones}.
%
Formally, we can write the reconfiguration event as follow: $\beta^{werable}_{server} \xrightarrow{\mathcal{E}} \beta^{werable}_{smartphone}$
where $\mathcal{E}$ represents the reconfiguration event due to the high load in the \emph{Server}.

At the start of the system, each \emph{Werable} device, with the $\sigma$ component,
start to perceive the other devices in the laboratory using the RSSI signal from the Bluetooth.
%
The $\beta$ component, initially executed in the \emph{Server}, starts to compute the distances from the other devices
based on the received RSSI signal from the $\sigma$ component.
%
Once the distances are computed, the $\chi$ component sends the data to the
\emph{Laboratory} containing the dinstances perceived by the device.
%

Similarity, the \emph{Laboratory} device has all the components executed in the \emph{Local PC},
where the $\chi$ component receives the data from the \emph{Wearable},
the $\beta$ component computes the mean distance between the devices.
%
The $\kappa$ component persist in memory the updated devices grpah based on the distances retreived by the $\chi$ component.
and the $\alpha$ component show in the monitor the color based on the mean distance computed by the $\beta$ component.

As soon as the reconfiguration event is triggered, the $\beta$ component of the \emph{Werable} is moved from the \emph{Server} to the \emph{Smartphone}
lighteninig the server and preserving from one side the functional semantic of the system and from the other side maintain the system operational.
%
The reconfiguration of the system in entirely managed by the framework, which handle all the machinery and communication to move the component from
one host to another.
%
With this simple example we show how the pulverization framework can be used in practice to manage a system with different devices and an heterogeneous
infrastructure.
%
Moreover, we show how the pulverization framework can be used adapt the system to changing requirement without loosing the funcional semantic of the system
by describing the system in a declarative way.

\section{Related Work}

This work provides 
 \acp{dsl}
 for specifying 
 distributed systems and
 corresponding deployment plans,
 and a framework for executing
 deployment plans and reconfigurations.
%
Therefore, we provide an original solution
 to different issues.
%
In~\cite{DBLP:journals/jss/ArcangeliBL15},
the problem of (automatic) deployment of distributed software system is studied by considering
 (i) the nature of software to be deployed,
 (ii) the nature of the deployment domain (i.e. the available infrastructure),
 (iii) how the deployment is designed,
 and 
 (iv) how the deployment is performed.
%
Accordingly, 
 we cover related works about
 languages for 
 specifying distributed systems (\Cref{sec:rw:whatsw}),
 languages for specifying infrastructures and deployments (\Cref{sec:rw:depdesc}),
 and
 techniques for automatic deployment and reconfiguration (\Cref{sec:rw:autodep}).
 
 
 
\subsection{Application description languages: component-based software engineering and the pulverisation model}
\label{sec:rw:whatsw}
%
%% A first distinction revolves around whether 
%% the distributed software to be deployed 
%% is a monolith 
%% or is already broken into different components.
%
We consider a distributed application 
 as a graph of deployable units.
%
This partitioning may be 
 manually specified at development time
 (e.g., by explicitly defining and packaging different components)
 or automatically defined
 through \emph{application partitioning} approaches~\cite{DBLP:journals/jnca/LiuASGBQ15}. %exploiting the natural modularity of code (depending on the paradigm and language adopted).
 
In our approach, the application partitioning into components is manually specified through a \ac{dsl}.
%
Therefore, it can be framed in the context of \emph{component-based software engineering},
 with ~\cite{vale2016component-based-se} providing a comprehensive review.
%
The specification or design of distributed systems
 may leverage
 component models~\cite{DBLP:journals/tse/CrnkovicSVC11},
 architectural description languages~\cite{DBLP:journals/tse/MedvidovicT00},
 or frameworks.
%

Specifically,
 this work generalises over the \emph{pulverisation model}~\cite{FI2020-pulverization,IEEE-IoTJ-pulverization-simulation},
 whereby a large-scale cyber-physical system
 is partitioned into a graph of devices
 where each device is split into five deployable components:
 (i) sensors interface, 
 (ii) actuators interface, 
 (iii) behaviour, 
 (iv) state, and 
 (v) communication component.
%
In~\cite{IEEE-IoTJ-pulverization-simulation},
 a methodology on top of the pulverisation model
 is proposed
 for generating and testing deployments through simulation.

Also,
 the approach of specifying in a single codebase 
 parts of the structure, behaviour, and/or interaction 
 for a whole distributed system
 is also related to \emph{macroprogramming}~\cite{Casadei2023macro}
 and, in particular, to \emph{multi-tier programming} paradigm~\cite{DBLP:journals/csur/WeisenburgerWS20},
 where the deployment units for different tiers (e.g., client and server tiers; or view, business logic, and data tiers) are obrained by compilation or interpretation of a single codebase.

\label{sec:rw:depdesc}

\subsection{Automatic deployment and reconfiguration}
\label{sec:rw:autodep}
%
A comprehensive conceptual framework
 on automatic deployment of distributed systems
 is provided in a 2015 survey by Arcangeli et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/jss/ArcangeliBL15}.
%
A more recent survey by Coullon et al. focusses
 on formal techniques for verifying the correctness of reconfigurations
 in component-based distributed software systems~\cite{coullon2023swreconfig}.

\meta{TODO: say something about our positioning wrt verification of reconfigurations}

In the \emph{osmotic computing} approach~\cite{DBLP:journals/computer/VillariFDRJR19},
 microservices (the solvent)
 can migrate across

 passing through layer boundaries (the semi-permeable membranes),
 in order to keep a balance in the desired properties (the solute).

%We highlight a number of representatieve research efforts on deployment and automatic reconfiguration of systems.

%by automatically migrating microservices to deployment locations.
%
However, the approach mainly targets centrally orchestrated systems.
%
Other approaches leverage component-based, architectural descriptions to decouple application logic and deployment.

For instance, \emph{DR-BIP (Dynamically Reconfigurable - Behaviour Interaction Priority model)}~\cite{,Ballouli18dr-bip}
and \emph{DReAM (Dynamically Reconfigurable Architectural Modelling)}~\cite{denicola2020dream-dynamic-reconfig-arch-modelling}

\emph{maps} (logical topologies),
and \emph{deployments} (associating components to map locations),
overall organised in \emph{motifs} (dynamic architectural configurations),
to model and analyse dynamic architectures.

These approaches have some similarity with the approach presented in this paper, but they are arguably more complex and our
